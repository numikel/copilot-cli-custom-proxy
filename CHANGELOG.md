# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-09

### Security
- **Network exposure is now opt-in and token-protected** — by default the proxy
  binds to loopback only. Binding beyond `127.0.0.1` requires turning on a new
  *Expose to network* switch in the settings window, which mints a gateway token.
  Once exposed, requests from non-loopback clients must carry that token as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or are rejected with `401`; loopback clients
  (including the locally launched CLI agents) are exempt. The token is shown in
  the UI with copy/regenerate actions and persists in `config.json` (it is a
  self-generated gateway credential, distinct from your upstream API key, which
  stays in memory only). A non-loopback address without the opt-in is reset to
  the loopback default on load.

### Fixed
- **Models with unlucky names are no longer hidden** — model classification now
  matches on word boundaries instead of raw substrings, so ids like `watts-3b`
  or `vanguard-instruct` are correctly treated as chat models rather than being
  filed as audio/moderation and dropped from the tray.
- **Corrupt config/preferences are reported, not silently dropped** — when
  `config.json` or `ui_state.json` is present but unparseable, the reason is now
  logged (a missing file stays silent, as before) so a lost configuration is
  diagnosable.
- **Crash-safe writes** — `config.json` and `ui_state.json` are written to a
  temporary file and atomically renamed into place, so an interrupted write
  (crash, forced kill, power loss) can no longer leave a truncated file.
- **No lost updates to tray-visibility preferences** — the read-modify-write of
  `ui_state.json` is serialized, so concurrent saves can't clobber each other.

### Changed
- The launched CLI agents always target the proxy via `127.0.0.1` (using the
  configured port), even when the proxy is bound to a wildcard/LAN address — so
  the local launch path keeps working without the gateway token.
- `proxy-core` adds `is_loopback_listen_addr`, `generate_proxy_token`, and the
  `expose_to_network` / `proxy_token` runtime-config fields; the served router
  now enforces a peer-aware gateway-auth layer. New Tauri commands
  `set_expose_to_network` and `regenerate_proxy_token`.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-09

### Security
- **Strict listen-address validation** — the host part of the listen address is
  now restricted to a conservative character set (letters, digits, `-`, `.`, and
  bracketed IPv6 literals), and the port must be 1–65535. This prevents shell
  metacharacters from reaching the launched CLI's command line. As
  defence-in-depth, the proxy base URL passed to the Codex launcher is wrapped in
  a quoted string (and rejected outright if it contains a quote).
- **Endpoint URLs may no longer embed credentials** — a `user:pass@host` authority
  is rejected, so a key accidentally pasted into the URL can't be persisted to
  `config.json` or written to logs.
- **Config is re-validated on startup** — a hand-edited or swapped-out
  `config.json` is sanitized when loaded: an invalid listen address falls back to
  the loopback default and an invalid endpoint URL is cleared (opening setup),
  rather than being trusted blindly.

### Fixed
- **No more empty `model` during an endpoint change** — switching the endpoint
  now fetches the new catalog *before* swapping, then replaces the URL and model
  list atomically. Previously a request landing mid-switch could be forwarded with
  an empty model field. The current selection is preserved when it still exists in
  the new catalog.
- **Reliable proxy restart on listen-address change** — the background server is
  now shut down gracefully (releasing its port) before the replacement binds, and
  the new address is bound up front so a failure (e.g. the port is already in use)
  is reported in the UI instead of silently leaving the proxy down. Re-confirming
  the same address is a no-op.

### Changed
- `proxy-core` adds `fetch_models_from` (probe a candidate endpoint without
  mutating state), `AppState::swap_endpoint` (atomic URL + catalog swap), and
  `serve_with` (run on a pre-bound listener with graceful shutdown). `serve`
  becomes a thin wrapper over `serve_with`.
- `set_listen_addr` is now async (binds the new address before restarting).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **In-app configuration** — the endpoint and the local listen address are now
  set in the settings window (no `config.toml` editing required) and persist to
  `config.json` next to the executable (`set_endpoint`, `set_listen_addr`
  commands). The API key remains in memory only.
- **Full-URL endpoint model with a chat ⟷ responses switch** — you enter the
  complete upstream URL (e.g. `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/responses`); the wire
  API is **derived from the URL suffix** rather than declared separately. A
  single-active switch in the settings window flips the suffix between
  `/chat/completions` and `/responses`. Stopping the URL at `/v1` is rejected
  (the API type would be ambiguous). New `proxy-core` module `settings.rs`
  (`RuntimeConfig`, `ApiKind`, `validate_endpoint_url`, `validate_listen_addr`).
- **Graceful first run** — a missing config no longer shows an error and exits;
  the app starts with defaults and opens the settings window so you can configure
  the endpoint.
- **Live listen-address changes** — changing the address restarts only the
  background proxy task (abort + respawn), without restarting the app or terminal.

### Changed
- `AppState` now holds a mutable `RuntimeConfig` (endpoint URL + listen address +
  default model) with accessors (`endpoint_url()`, `base_url()`, `models_url()`,
  `active_api()`, `listen_addr()`) and persistence via `set_config_path`.
- Agent gating is now based on the single **active** API (derived from the
  endpoint URL): exactly one of Copilot/Codex is enabled at a time.
- `StateView` drops `corporate_base_url` / `upstream_apis`; adds `endpoint_url`
  and `active_api`.
- `config.toml` is now an **optional one-time seed**: on first run it is migrated
  into `config.json` (base URL + first API → full endpoint URL), then ignored.

### Migration
- Existing `config.toml` installs keep working: the first 0.3.0 launch migrates
  them to `config.json`. `config.json` is gitignored.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Redesigned settings window** recreated 1:1 from the design handoff: a
  frameless (`decorations: false`) window with a custom title bar (drag region +
  minimize / maximize / close), status pill, and toast notifications.
- **Dark / light theme toggle** (defaults to dark; persisted in `localStorage`).
- **Model classification** in `proxy-core`: `fetch_models` now returns
  `ModelInfo { id, chat, kind }`, inferring non-chat families (`embed`, `image`,
  `audio`, `rerank`, `moderation`) from the model id. The settings window can
  **hide non-chat models** (on by default) and tags the rest by kind.
- **Two-state tray icon** — accent-filled when the proxy is ready, muted outline
  when idle.
- **Tray "Models" submenu** — models moved off the first level so
  "Open Settings…"/"Quit" stay reachable with large catalogs (e.g. OpenRouter).
- **Per-endpoint tray-visibility curation** — pick which chat models appear in
  the tray submenu (checkbox per model, all/none, shift-click range), persisted
  to `ui_state.json` keyed by endpoint (`set_visible_models` command).
- `forget_api_key` command to clear the in-memory key from the UI.
- IBM Plex Sans/Mono fonts bundled locally (no CDN; keeps the `'self'` CSP).

### Changed
- `AppState` now stores `Vec<ModelInfo>` instead of `Vec<String>`; added
  `model_ids()` and `chat_model_ids()` helpers.
- Settings window narrowed to 444 px to match the design; status values are now
  polled live (~1.5 s) from the real `request_log` (no simulated traffic).
- `tauri` built with the `image-png` feature for runtime tray-icon swapping;
  window capabilities extended with `minimize` / `toggle-maximize` / `close` /
  `start-dragging` permissions.

### Notes
- Launchable agents remain Copilot and Codex, but the agent enum / gating / UI
  are structured so additional agents are a single match-arm to add.

## [0.1.0]

- Initial release: tray proxy with live model switching (Rust + Tauri v2),
  Copilot and Codex launchers, in-memory API key, live request logging.
